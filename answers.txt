5.	Modify existing tests to run on a real device. What should be changed?

We need to change deviceName from emulator-5554 to real device name,
which we can find through cmd using adb commands.
Add Appium capability with real deviceName properties.


6.	Connect a real device to Appium (describe required actions) and run tests.
Are there any difference with run on emulator?

We need to connect real device into work station through USB cord.
Also we can add Appium capabilities with proper deviceName.

There are some differences:
    1. we need to have real device with expected parameters,
        emulator can be run on your workstation with all you need parameters and settings
    2. emulator use lots of workstation resources and makes work slowly
    3. real device faster than emulator
    4. emulator doesn't have all functionality as real device and can have minor differences in behavior
